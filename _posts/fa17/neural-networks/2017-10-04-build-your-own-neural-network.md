excerpt: >
    This workshop will take you through a more rigorous understanding of backpropagation. Once we have a solid understanding of that, we'll write up our own Neural Network in Python to classify MNIST data. To finish things off, we'll look at how you'd implement this in TensorFlow and talk, abstractly, about the differenes and benefits/drawbacks of baking your own versus pre-baked libraries.
