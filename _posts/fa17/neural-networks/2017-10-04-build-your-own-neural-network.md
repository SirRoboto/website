excerpt: >
    This lecture introduces you the Fall semester of <span class="ucfsigai-brand">SIGAI@UCF</span> and then dives into a lecture on Neural Networks. We start out with a high-level look at the inception and initial progression in Neural Nets, then move on to actually building an intuition behind how they work and how Neural Networks achieve some of their learning prowess.
