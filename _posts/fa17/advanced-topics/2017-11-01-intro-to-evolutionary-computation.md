excerpt: >
    Reinforcement Learning is an entire paradigm of Artificial Intelligence; because of this, we'll split this lecture up across two meetings, otherwise we'd have to move too quickly for it to be meaningful and useful. With that in mind, we'll talk about how Reinforcement Learning is different from other methodoligies in Machine Learning, how RL is formalized, and what a Markov Decision Process is.
