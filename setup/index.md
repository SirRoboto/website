We do our best to support every OS we can, however there are some nuances to each.
Particularly Windows – in each of the sub-pages, we detail them all, so please hop 
on over to your OS' respective page.

Just something to note, as this **_is_** primarily a computer-science focused 
organization, we'll opt for Terminal/Command Prompt usage as much as possible.
This shouldn't be intimidating, and if you find it so – **please ping** one of the 
coordinators on the Slack, or fire off an email to us!
