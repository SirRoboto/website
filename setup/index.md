**As of the Fall 2018 semester** we've moved our meetings to the local CPU/GPU 
clusters, on campus! :smiley: Although we have instructions for Docker and the 
like, they're presently un-managed, as we have a very tightly controlled 
environment on the CPU/GPU cluster. We simply need you to *setup your SSH 
credentials* to gain access.


We do our best to support every OS we can, however there are some nuances to each.
Particularly Windows â€“ in each of the sub-pages, we detail them all, so please hop 
on over to your OS' respective page.

As this club started out as a primarily computer science / engineering focused 
organization... we'll opt for Terminal/Command Prompt usage whenever possible.
If you find this intimidating, **don't hesitate to ping** one of the 
Coordinators on Slack! :thumbsup:
