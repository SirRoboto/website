SIGAI is the Special Interest Group for Artificial Intelligence. Our parent organization is [ACM@UCF](http://acm.cs.ucf.edu/). Supported by local faculty, entrepreneurs, and experts; we provide lectures, workshops, and support to give you the knowledge and tools to bring us closer to general machine intelligence.

**We meet every Monday at 7:00 PM in MSB 406.**
